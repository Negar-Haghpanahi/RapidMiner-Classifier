# RapidMiner-Classifier
This is a collaborative project that I have done with two of my classmates for the data mining course.
Introduction:
This project consists of two main sections. In the first part, you will perform data preprocessing using RapidMiner software on the Labor-Negotiations dataset, which contains a limited number of samples. The preprocessing steps may involve handling missing data (e.g., replacing with means, deleting samples, or feature removal) and other data preparation tasks.

The second part of the project focuses on solving a multi-class classification problem using the RapidMiner tool and the decision tree classifier. You have the option to choose between two datasets for this classification task: the Glass dataset, which involves classifying glass types based on their chemical properties, and the Heart dataset, which deals with predicting heart disease.

Key tasks for this project include:

Data preprocessing, such as normalization and handling missing values.
Implementing k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
Analyzing and reporting results using different evaluation approaches.
Creating scatter plots to visualize feature importance.
Optional: Generating a heatmap of the confusion matrix for additional insights.
